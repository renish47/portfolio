          Hello, I'm Renishkar, a passionate full stack web developer. I have a
          deep love for coding and problem-solving, and I thrive on the
          challenges that come with building innovative and user-friendly web
          applications. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end
          development, I enjoy creating seamless and dynamic experiences for
          users.

              My journey into the world of programming began after I watched the
              series named "Silicon Valley" during lockdown. The show's
              portrayal of coding like a super power fascinated me, igniting a
              strong attraction towards the world of programming. Since then, I
              have embraced coding as a means to bring ideas to life and make a
              tangible impact. As a movie buff, I appreciate the art of
              storytelling and enjoy the cinematic experience, allowing me to
              combine my technical expertise with my creative vision.
            </p>
            <p className=" pt-6">
              I am constantly learning and exploring new technologies to stay
              up-to-date with the latest trends in web development. Lastly, I am
              a huge fan of working with like-minded individuals, as
              collaboration fuels my creativity and helps me grow both
              personally and professionally.
